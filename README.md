# win32-collectd ![icon](icon.png)

This small VB6 program outputs over COM1 collectd strings about the state of the system, you can use this on your hypervisor to export it into collectd and your
monitoring/metrics solution.

I feel bad for you if you are running windows 98 in a even slighly production function.
